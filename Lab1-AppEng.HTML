        <p>As I have progessed through the Computer Science Major, I have slowly been exposed to 
        topics and subjects. Some I really enjoy, others I have distain for, or simply feelings of neutralness.
        One thing that I didn't anticipate when enrolling at 21, was slowly falling back in love with
        my childhood dream of being an Arichitect/Engineer.
        </p>

        <p>With regards to the prevously mentioned intests, the technologies that I wouldn't mind learning
        and implementing relevent to web development are now tied to STEM and Computational Science.
        One concept that I have thought about is the ability to remotely connect to an HPC to run
        Muiltiphysics FEA simulations. I have heard of retatable "supercomputers", where on can
        rent 1 or more nodes of the HPC to run calculations on (whith built in MPI). Although I don't know
        this could even be considered as a Web Application unless the Web is used as a middle man to connect
        a user's project/file to the HPC.
